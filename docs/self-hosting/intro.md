# Introduction

Welcome to the **Self-Hosting** section of the **solidtime documentation**!
This guide is for users who want to learn how to self-host solidtime.

If you have problems with the self-hosting guide, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/solidtime-io/solidtime/issues) or join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Ge6mJpapVR).

## Getting Started

We currently provide a detailed guide on how to deploy solidtime using Docker/Docker Compose.

You can find the guide [here](/self-hosting/guides/docker).

## FAQ
