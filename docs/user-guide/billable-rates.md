# Billable rates

Billable rates is a price per hour for time tracked in solidtime.

Billable rates can be set on multiple levels:
 1. **Project member** - for a specific user in a specific project
 2. **Project** - for all users in a specific project
 3. **Organization member** - for a specific user in the organization
 4. **Organization** - for all users

Setting the billable rate is optional on all levels.
The billable rate on a level overwrites the billable rate of the level above. (Level 1 overwrites level 2, level 2 overwrites level 3, etc.)

**Example 1:**

A user called Bob is a member of the organization and tracks 3 hours on a project called "Project A".

- Organization billable rate: 50€
- Project billable rate: 60€
- Bob's billable rate in "Project A": 70€

Bob's tracked time in "Project A" will be billed with 70€ per hour.

**Example 2:**

A user called Alice is a member of the organization and tracks 3 hours on a project called "Project B".

- Organization billable rate: 50€
- Alice's billable rate in the organization: 70€
- Project billable rate: 60€
- Alice's billable rate in "Project B": not set

Alice's tracked time in "Project B" will be billed with the projects billable rate 60€ per hour, since she does not have a billable rate set on her own in the project.

## How to set billable rates

In the following sections, you will learn how to set billable rates on different levels.
In general, the process is the same for all levels.
Before you update a billable rate, you will be asked if you want to apply the new billable rate to existing time entries or only to new time entries.

If you choose to apply the billable rate to existing time entries, only the time entries that use the specific billable rate will be updated. If a time entry has a billable rate set on a higher level, the time entry will not be updated.

**Example:**

Bob and Alice are members of the organization "Great company".
Bob tracks 3 hours on "Project A". The billable rate for Bob in "Project A" is 100€.
Alice tracks 4 hours without a project.

The administrator of the organization now sets the billable rate for the organization to 50€ and applies the new billable rate to existing time entries.
This will update Alice's time entries to 50€ per hour, but Bob's time entries will stay at 100€ per hour, since the project billable rate has a higher priority.
